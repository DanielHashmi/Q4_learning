What is an LLM?

An LLM, or Large Language Model, is a smart computer program that has read huge amounts of text from books, websites, and other places.

It learns patterns in how people use words, so it can talk, write, or answer questions in a way that sounds human.

It doesnâ€™t understand like a person does.

Instead, it looks at the words you give it and guesses what the next words should be, based on what it has seen before.

The more text it reads during training, the better it gets.

People use LLMs for chatting, writing stories or emails, translating languages, summarizing things, coding help, and more all by just typing in plain language.
