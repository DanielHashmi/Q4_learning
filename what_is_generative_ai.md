Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content by learning patterns, styles, and rules from the data it was trained on. This data can include text, images, or other formats. 

For example, if we train a text-based generative AI with a large amount of text, it learns how sentences are structured and how words relate to each other. If you ask it, "What is an apple?" it might respond, "An apple is a fruit," based on what it learned from the training data.

generative AI creates new things by using the knowledge it has gained. For instance, if we train it to reply to "How are you?" with either "I'm fine, thanks" or "I'm good," it might come up with a new response like, "I'm good, thanks," by mixing parts of what it learned. This ability to create something new is what makes generative AI special.

generative AI is a program that learns patterns and styles from data to create unique content, without simply copying what it has seen before.
