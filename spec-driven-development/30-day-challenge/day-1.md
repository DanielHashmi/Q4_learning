### AIDD 30-Day Challenge — Task 1 Submission

Understood AIDD as AI-human collaboration in development, with October 2025 marking mainstream AI tools changing developers to collaborators.

Reviewed AI-Native Book Preface. Key: AI + human creativity for new era; developers as collaborators; October 2025 as turning point due to tools like ChatGPT.

Installed Gemini CLI via `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`. Verified with `gemini --version`.

What does AI-Driven Development mean to you?

AI-Driven Development means I'm no longer just typing code alone. Now, I work with AI like a partner. Think of it as having a really helpful team member who can write code, find bugs, and even help plan how to build things based on my ideas. Instead of wasting time on boring, repetitive tasks, I can think about what really matters what problem am I solving? Who will use this? Is it fair and can it grow? This makes building software easier for everyone. I can make bigger projects happen faster because AI is good at spotting patterns and doing automatic work, while I bring unique ideas and careful thinking. It's exciting because suddenly, I can turn a rough idea into a real app in just hours instead of weeks. But I also need to be careful, I have to check what the AI creates to make sure there are no mistakes or unfair parts. So it becomes a loop: I ask, AI creates, I check and improve, then we try again.

How do you see the future of Human-AI Collaboration in software development?

I think working with AI will soon be normal for all developers. AI will feel like a natural part of how we think and work smooth, easy, and getting better all the time. In a few years, we might have different AI helpers doing different jobs: one writes the plan, another writes code, and another tests it. We humans will invest of time building new revolutionary ideas just like AI, making sure everything works together. We'll focus on new ideas, doing the right thing, and understanding what users really need, things AI still can't fully do. We might even draw something on paper, take a picture, and have AI turn it into working code. Solo developers will be able to build huge apps that used to need whole teams. Of course, we'll need to learn new things like how to talk to AI better and how to use it responsibly. There will be problems too, sometimes AI makes mistakes or people worry about losing jobs. But overall, I'm hopeful. More people can build things, we can work faster, and we can solve big problems in schools, hospitals, and more.
